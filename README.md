# Incarceration in Real Numbers

## About

[Incarceration in real numbers](https://jerseylen.github.io/incarceration-in-real-numbers) is a data visualization project that launched in autumn 2020.

## A word about words

The terms "jail" and "prison" are not interchangeable. A jail is a place where accused criminals are held while awaiting trial, or where convicted criminals serve short sentences for minor crimes. Jails are typically operated by county or city governments. A prison is an institution where convicted criminals are held for serious crimes, typically serving sentences of a year or more. Prisons are typically operated by the federal or state governments. [Rikers Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island) is a jail. [Sing sing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_Sing) is a prison.
